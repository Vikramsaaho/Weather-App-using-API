# Weather-App-using-API

Weather App using API – Python Project
Description:
Developed a Python-based weather application that fetches and displays real-time weather information for any city using a third-party weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap). The app provides key data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions, and includes error handling for invalid inputs and connection issues.

Key Features:

API integration to fetch real-time weather data.

User input to search weather by city name.

Displays temperature (°C/°F), humidity, pressure, and conditions.

Clean and user-friendly terminal/GUI interface.

Handles invalid cities and network errors gracefully.

Optional: GUI built using Tkinter or PyQt for a richer experience.

Tech Stack:

Language: Python

Libraries: requests, json, Tkinter (for GUI version)

API Used: OpenWeatherMap / WeatherAPI

Tools: Python IDLE, VS Code

Contributions & Achievements:

Implemented efficient error handling and response parsing.

Optimized API request flow to reduce latency.

Contributed to peer code reviews and performance tuning.

Gained hands-on experience working with REST APIs and JSON parsing.
